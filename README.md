This is a sample SPRING BOOT REST API APP, developed with
Java 8. It's a CRUD App that contains REST API(s), where the
Base URL End Point is " http://localhost:8080/ " 
(the SPRING BOOT APP should be already run to access to 
the End Point URL) followed by the rest of the service
you want to test it, where it can be tested on the "Postman"
app as a REST client for example.

This app, was developed for a technical interview.
So, I put it in GitHub to help other who searches for examples
of a SPRING BOOT CRUD REST API APP(s).

**NOTE:** the project was made with "Intellij IDE", so if you will
import this project in another "IDE / Text Editor", please 
DO NOT implement the file "spring_boot_app_job_solutions_xpr_canada.iml"
because it's provided by "Intellij IDE" when the project was
created.

Thank you.
